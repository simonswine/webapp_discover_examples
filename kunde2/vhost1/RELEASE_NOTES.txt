RELEASE NOTES FOR TYPO3 3.7.1
*******************************

This document contains important information for upgrades to TYPO3 3.7.x.
If you are upgrading from TYPO3 3.7.0 to 3.7.1 then you can simply ignore
this document.


This document was taken from
http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/TYPO3_3.7.0_Upgrade

It contains last minute information about what kind of problem you can
see during an upgrade from TYPO3 version 3.6.x to 3.7.0.

In TYPO3 3.7.0 there are some changes within the extension structure.
Some extensions which were considered as normal extensions are now system
extensions. That means they are now part of the TYPO3 source distribution.

After an upgrade you may encounter the following problem. Some of the
new system extensions could still be found in typo3/ext/ or probably
typo3conf/ext/. Depending on how you upgraded your TYPO3 installation,
some new system extensions might be overridden by their old predecessor.

Example:
If you've just copied the latest release over an old installation, then
the directory "install" located in the global TYPO3 extension folder,
typo3/ext/, will conflict with the new "install" which is now a system
extension.

Solution:
You must remove the old extension from the ext/ folders to avoid conflict.

The extensions in conflict may be located in these places:
  local extensions      =   typo3conf/ext/
  global extensions     =   typo3/ext/

- Remove directories in global ext/ folder and local ext/ folder if they
  are now in sysext/
- Extra: make sure that typo3/ext/extrep_wizard is deleted (this has
  been replaced with the "kickstarter" extension)
- Finally, clear all temp_CACHED_* files (either with the link in the
  BE or manually)

Here is the list of extensions to remove:
  aboutmodules
  context_help
  extra_page_cm_options
  func_wizards
  info_pagetsconfig
  install
  setup
  tsconfig_help
  wizard_crpages
  wizard_sortpages
  extrep_wizard (replaced with "kickstarter")

After removing these extensions you can continue with upgrading your
TYPO3 installation as it is explained in the "Installation and Upgrade"
manual: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/doc_inst_upgr/

As usual, you should check the mailing list archives if you have further
questions: http://typo3.org/documentation/mailing-lists/
