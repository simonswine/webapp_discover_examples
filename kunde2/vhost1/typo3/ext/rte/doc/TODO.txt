TODO

- Ability to insert the "_rtekeep" flag in the link-box
- Further "clean up" the JavaScript code of the RTE
- Import HTML in the RTE. Done as a "wizard" for that field? (reads HTML through a parser for the RTE)
- Magic Image should be a choice when you *select* image, not a menu-choice as it is now.
- Remove the image-files found in the extension originally though as placeholders for "template editing"
- Attach a stylesheet file.
- Maybe detect classes automatically from stylesheet file?
- Ampersand problem in saved content - and generally the conversion to entities. How to handle?

Table editor:
The RTE's tableeditor needs to be improved a lot with options for inserting, deleting, merging cells. Somebody with knowledge of DHTML and insight into the RTE's JavaScript library is required for this task. I relies mostly on JavaScript. To investigate/play with it see in your typo3 source in rte.js
- tablecolumns and rows added/deleted/joined/splitted by either popup or buttons in toolbar.
- Adding paragraph "signs" after paragraphs"

Documentation:
- [From Ben:] There is a serious need for some examples. 
- [From Ben:] Would be nice if we can have some preconfiguration extensions for RTE processing.
